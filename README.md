This is an attempt to exercise BBEdit 10's package feature combined with my need to trick BBEdit out to handle Zend Framework better.

Currenly contains a tags file for the latest Zend Framework, and some misc bits from my own BBEdit config (clippings, etc).

Text Filters:

	basic wrapper for PHP_Beautify - better than nothing.

Clippings:

	Copyright - a generic copyright statement. (we use this at work, YMMV)
	docblock - generic docblock
	partial - partial for templates
	partialLoop - partialloop for templates
